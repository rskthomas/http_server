        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Thomas Rusiecki, a B.Sc. computer science student from
          Argentina ðŸ§‰ looking for an entry-level developer job where I can learn and grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've got a love for Rust and a avid defender of the C programming language. I'm also a big fan of Python and its ecosystem, given it is simple to use and has a lot of libraries for almost anything. 
          Im confident in my ability to learn new languages and technologies quickly, so I'm always looking for new technologies to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            While design and front-end GUI development are not my strong suits, I'm passionate about back-end development, data management, and algorithm implementation.
        </p>

        <p><b>Project: HTTP Server in Rust</b></p>
        <p>
          Following the book "The Rust Programming Language", I'm developing a
          simple Rust HTTP server for educational purposes, it's running this
          site right now!
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is to build a full-fledged HTTP 1.0 server following RFC
          1945.

        <p><b>Project: File transfer in C using sockets</b></p>
        <p>
          Currently developing two simple file transfer programs using sockets
          in C for the class "Distributed Systems" at the University of La
          Plata.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them is using TCP and the other one is using UDP, the idea is
          to compare the performance of both protocols.
